# Tree - NonLinear Data Structure
A `tree` data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels. In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type.

## General Tree
A `general tree` data structure has no restriction on the number of nodes. It means that a parent node can have any number of child nodes.

</br>
</br>

## Binary Tree
A node of a `binary tree` can have a maximum of two child nodes. In the given tree diagram, node B, D, and F are left children, while E, C, and G are the right children.

## Balanced Tree
If the height of the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree is equal or differs at most by 1, the tree is known as a `balanced tree`.
