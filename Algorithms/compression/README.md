# Compression Algorithms
A **compression algorithm** is a set of instructions or steps used to convert
data from its original format to a compressed format. These algorithms aim
to reduce the size of data by removing redundancy or encoding it in a more
efficient representation. The compressed data can often be decompressed
back to its original form without any significant loss of information.

However, it's important to note that while some compression algorithms
are lossless, meaning they retain all the original data, others are
lossy and may introduce some level of data loss during compression.

## Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
RLE is a simple form of compression that replaces consecutive repeated
characters or data elements with a count and a single instance of the
character or data element. It is commonly used for compressing images
or sequences with long runs of the same symbol.
