# Sorting Algorithms
A **sorting algorithm** is a set of instructions or steps used to arrange
elements in a specific order. These algorithms take an unsorted collection
of data and reorder it according to a defined criteria.

The process of sorting involves comparing elements and repositioning them
based on their values. Sorting algorithms can vary in their efficiency,
stability, and suitability for different types and sizes of data.

## Selection Sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly
finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and
placing it at the beginning. This process is repeated until the entire
list is sorted.

## Insertion Sort
nsertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly
inserting elements from an unsorted portion of the array into their
correct positions in a sorted portion of the array. It is an in-place
comparison-based algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2), making it
efficient for small data sets or partially sorted arrays.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly going
through a list of elements and comparing adjacent pairs. If the elements
are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This process is repeated until
the entire list is sorted.

## Quicksort
Quicksort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It
works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two
sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays
are then recursively sorted.
