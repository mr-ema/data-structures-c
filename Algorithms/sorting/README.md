# Sorting Algorithms
A **sorting algorithm** is a set of instructions or steps used to arrange
elements in a specific order. These algorithms take an unsorted collection
of data and reorder it according to a defined criteria.

The process of sorting involves comparing elements and repositioning them
based on their values. Sorting algorithms can vary in their efficiency,
stability, and suitability for different types and sizes of data.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly going
through a list of elements and comparing adjacent pairs. If the elements
are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This process is repeated until
the entire list is sorted.

Imagine you have a row of numbers that are not in the correct order, and you want to sort them using bubble sort. Here's how it works:

1. Start at the beginning of the row.
2. Compare the first number with the second number. If the first number is greater than the second number, you swap their positions.
3. Move to the next pair of numbers (the second and third numbers) and compare them. Again, swap them if they are in the wrong order.
4. Continue this process, comparing and swapping adjacent numbers as you move along the row.
5. Keep going until you reach the end of the row. By this point, the largest number will have "bubbled up" to the rightmost position.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining unsorted part of the row, excluding the last element that you already sorted.
7. Keep repeating this process until the entire row is sorted.
