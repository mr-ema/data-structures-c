# Conversion Algorithms
A **conversion algorithm** is a set of instructions or steps used to convert data from one format to another.
The process of conversion can involve changing the structure of data, altering its encoding or representation, or translating it from one language to another.

## Infix To Postfix
One of the reasons of why **Postfix** and **Prefix** expressions are
important is that they are easily evaluated by computers: Postfix and
Prefix expressions can be evaluated efficiently by computers using a
stack-based algorithm. This makes them useful in computer programming
and engineering applications where performance is important.
