# MyLib
To avoid rewriting the same code repeatedly, I have defined the necessary structures here. This way, whenever I
need a queue, I can simply include the code and use the pre-defined queue without having to start from scratch.

> I'm using [acutest.h](https://github.com/mity/acutest/blob/master/include/acutest.h) and
> [list.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/list.h) as examples for my implementation.
> However, I want to emphasize that I am not an expert in C and this is a basic implementation.
> If you are creating libraries, I recommend looking at these examples and doing your own research.
